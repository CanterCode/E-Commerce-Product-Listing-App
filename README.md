# Module 3 Final Project
## E Commerce Product Listing App

This is my submission for the Ecommerce App Project. I create an online men's shoe store. I used React with state and props to create cards that show the image and information of each shoe. I am actually very proud of how this turned out. I used multiple files in vs code to try and keep everything seperate and organized.
